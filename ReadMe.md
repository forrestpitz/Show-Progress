# Show-Progress

Show-Progress is a micro-module (only one function) designed to give you a clear indication of how items are flowing through the pipeline.

It measures items as they flow through and outputs at regular percentages (if you want less frequent updates you can also use the UpdatePercentage variable to set the percentage click stop to update on)

Its designed to be blazing fast to avoid as much impact as possible to the task you are running.
